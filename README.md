# ArrayListADT
Summary

A resizeable ArrayList ADT supporting addition, removal, and retrieval of elements.

Design

The ArrayList supports adding elements and will resize automatically when the load threshold is reached. Removal of an element will shift all elements at that index down to fill the empty index. Also supported is checking the first and last index of a speicific element occurrence, and the ability to set any valid index to a specified element. Other classic methods like clear, size, toString are supported.
